                    kind of learning that takes place via the Internet. Online learning gives educators an opportunity
                    to reach students who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom course and supports
                    students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own pace.</p>

                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Online teaching is here to stay. Many students prefer the online
                classroom since it offers flexibility in their busy schedules. With the proliferation of information and
                knowledge, students must become lifelong learners in today's world, and online education plays an
                important role in helping individuals access the learner-centered and self-directed instruction.

                With enhanced software, hardware, and Internet access, more options for online education will become
                available. With student enrollments increasing faster than classrooms can be built, students becoming
                more proficient with technology, and students pursuing an education that meets their needs, the future
                of online education will continue to grow. Online degree programs will become more widely accepted as
                they become a more common practice.</p>
